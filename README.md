This repository demonstrates a common C programming error involving pointers and how changes through pointers might not reflect in other variables if not correctly managed. The bug.c file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.c provides the corrected version.  The core issue stems from the misunderstanding that modifying a variable through a pointer automatically updates all copies of that variable. This only applies if the copy was itself a pointer to the same memory location.
